selection of (almost) all Public Domain SVG files.
Excluding tango library, as I could not confirm that it is Public Domain.

converted svg files with "svg_stack.py --direction=h --margin=100 *.svg > ../din.svg" to make them parseable by svg_stack.

then combined them with "svg_stack.py --direction=h --margin=100 din/*.svg > din.svg"
